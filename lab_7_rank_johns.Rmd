Hi this is Jason and I created this repo and markdown document.

wow this is a nice markdown document. :)

Collaborator Here! This is Erica 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)+
  theme_classic()
kermit_hist
```


rank based tests now from lily:
```{r}
#is there a sig difference in pretalk kermit scores for males and females

#wilcox is what you use for mann but unpaired
#unpaired so we are going to use Mann-whitney U 
mwukermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data= .)

mwukermit

#retain ho that there is no signficant difference in pretalk kermit ranks. #technically median can be used if distributions are similar across groups otherwise just ranks 
```
