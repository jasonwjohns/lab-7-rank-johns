Hi this is Jason and I created this repo and markdown document.

wow this is a nice markdown document. :)

Collaborator Here! This is Erica 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)+
  theme_classic()
kermit_hist
```

Creator: doing some rank-based tests.

```{r}

# Is there a significant difference in pre-talk kermit scores for males and females?

# Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>%
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit

```

There is no significant difference in pre-talk permit ranks for males and females.
